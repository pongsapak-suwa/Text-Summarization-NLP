## Summarization using NLP with pythainlp and python-crfsuite
In this notebook, we'll explore how to perform text summarization using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Specifically, we'll focus on summarizing Thai language text using the `pythainlp` library for preprocessing and the `python-crfsuite` library for named entity recognition (NER).
